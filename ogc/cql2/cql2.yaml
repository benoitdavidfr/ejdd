SimpleCQL:
  intro: |
    The Simple CQL conformance class defines the minimal subset of the Common Query Language (CQL) that all implementations must support ("Simple CQL"). Simple CQL is intended to be a minimal useful set of predicates that support enhanced fine-grained read-access to collections of resources. In this case, "enhanced" means filtering capabilities beyond those supported by the core OGC API Common standard (i.e., bbox, datetime and optionally collection-specific properties).
  operators:
    - The specific set of operators defined in this conformance class is
    - Logical operators:
      - and
      - or
      - not
    - Comparison operators:
      - equal to
      - less than
      - less than or equal to
      - greater than
      - greater than or equal to
      - like
      - is null
      - between
      - in
    - Spatial operators:
      - intersects
    - Temporal operators:
      - anyinteracts
